    bio: "After completing a PhD in genetics at the University of Lisbon and the CGM, Gif-sur-Yvette with R. Gomes and R. Karess, Renata Basto move to the team of Jordan Raff, at the Gurdon Institute, Cambridge UK as a post-doctoral fellow. She studied the consequences of centrosome number alterations in Drosophila. In 2009, she moved to the Cell Biology Department (UMR144) of the Institut Curie in Paris as a junior principal investigator (PI) with a CNRS position. She was promoted senior PI in 2014. R. Basto has been awarded with ERC starting and Consolidator grants, a EMBO YIP fellowship and was elected an EMBO member in 2017. Work in her lab addresses the mechanisms leading genetic instability and the consequences of centrosome and chromosome number alterations in a variety of model systems from Drosophila to human cancers."
