    bio: >
      Francisca Lottersberger is Associate professor and the head of the Laboratory of Genome Integrity at the Linköping University, in Sweden. 
      Francisca obtained her PhD in Industrial Biotechnology in 2006 at the University of Milano-Bicocca under the supervison of Maria Pia Longhese, using the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cereviase to study cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response.
      She then joined in 2008 the laboratory of Titia de Lange at the Rockefeller University. There, combining genetic approaches with live cell imaging analysis, she elucidated the role of the cytoskeleton and the LINC complex in promoting chromatin mobility after DNA damage response and the detrimental effect of increased chromatin mobility on the repair of multiple DSBs. 
      In parallel, she participated in elucidating the multiple factors involved in  promoting NHEJ and protecting DNA double strand breaks from aberrant resection.
      In 2018, Francisca was awarded a fellowship at the Wallenberg Center for Molecular Medicine (WCMMM) at the Linköping University and started her own research group focusing on the role of nuclear architecture in genome maintenance and the role of DNA damage proteins in telomere maintenance in normal and cancer cells.

    bio: |
      Marina Mione is the head of the Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Biology, at the University of Trento. She uses the powerful zebrafish to study telomere maintenance in different cancer models, including brain tumors and melanoma that she developed over the years.  She applies a wide variety of tools such as live imaging and genetic/pharmacological screens to explore different aspects of tumor biology, especially the inflammatory response triggered by tumors. 
      Marina obtained her degree in Medicine at the University La Sapienza in Rome and her PhD in Neuroscience at University College London. She was awarded a Welcome Trust Research Career Fellowship for her studies on the lineage of mouse cerebral cortical neurons, and in 2005 she moved to IFOM, Milan, as group leader, and switched her research interest towards cancer. At IFOM she established the zebrafish as a cancer model and started to study telomere maintenance and genome integrity in her models. From 2016 she is an associate Professor and now a full professor at the University of Trento, in the Cibio Department.
