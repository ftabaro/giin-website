    bio: "Dr. Davoli obtained her Ph.D. in 2013 from The Rockefeller University working with Dr. Titia de Lange on studying how telomere dysfunction promotes aneuploidy during tumorigenesis. During her postdoctoral training, she worked with Dr. Stephen Elledge using genomics approaches to understand the consequences of cancer aneuploidy for tumor formation and for therapy response in cancer patients. In May 2018, Dr. Davoli started her lab at the Institute for Systems Genetics at NYU School of Medicine in New York. Her lab uses functional genetics and computational approaches to study the causes and consequences of genomic instability in cancer. Dr. Davoli has received the Weintraub Graduate Student award in 2013 and she was a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Scholar. Dr. Davoli was a V Foundation Scholar and was also awarded the Melanoma Research Alliance Young Investigator Award, the Breast Cancer Alliance Young Investigator Award.<br><br>Her lab focuses on dissecting the causes and consequences of chromosome gains and losses in solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Dr. Davoli recently found that tumors with a high level of aneuploidy tend to be immune cold and to be refractory to immunotherapy. Her long-term goals are to decipher how aneuploidy can be utilized as a biomarker for therapy response and as a potential target for novel cancer treatments that take advantage of synthetic lethalities associated with the aneuploid state."
  - name: Ylli Doksani
    title: PhD
    institute: IFOM
    nation: Italy
    talk: "Two more things that can go wrong at telomeres"
    pic: "/assets/speakers/2021/11/doksani.png"
    bio: "Dr. Doksani completed his Ph.D. in Marco Foiani lab in 2008 at IFOM in Milan, Italy. He then moved to New York at the Rockfeller university for his postdoctoral training and started his own group at IFOM in April 2016. His research focuses on telomere structure and replication stress response at telomeres. During his work, Dr. Doksani developed a two-step procedure to purify mammalian telomeres for single molecules analysis. With his work he showed that telomere damage induces formation of intramolecular loops and identified the molecular mechanisms for the formation of extrachromosomal telomeric circles via excision of intramolecular loops."
