The Genome Integrity Italian Network (GiiN) is a scientific community founded in 2021 by Simona Giunta (University of Rome Sapienza) and Stefano Santaguida (Institute of Oncology; University of Milan) to bring together national and international laboratories that work in the field of genome stability. 

Our mission is to discuss and showcase the latest findings, as well as promote mobility, collaborations and opportunities for all colleagues working in our field. The initiative aims to harness the newfound opportunity of virtual connectivity enabling to create, enhance and facilitate interactions between active members of the GiiN community thereby encouraging multidisciplinarity and collaborations, and ultimately impacting scientific research related to the broad area of Genome Integrity in a positive way.
